    # Assume each attendee has some ranking of all the sessions in which they expressed interest.
    # (Not an unreasonable assumption.) Further assume that the attendee values their sessions of interest
    # linearly: least interested=1,2,3...N=most interested. (That's more of a stretch, but likely bears
    # some resemblance to reality.)
    #
    # In each timeslot, assume the attendee will choose the session they're most interested in. We don't
    # know attendee's actual ranking, so assume sessions of interest are distributed randomly in the schedule.
    # The expected maximum of a slot in which there are k sessions is v_slot = k(N+1)/(k+1). The total
    # value of all sessions is v_total = N(N+1)/2. The expected fraction of total value in one slot is
    # thus v_slot / v_total = 2k/(N(k+1)). Sum that over all slots to get the attendee's overall satisfaction.
    #
    # A similar logic applies to presenters avoiding double-booking.
    #
    # (The old scheduling algorithm didn't take into account how deep the overlap ran within a given slot,
    # essentially set v_slot = {1/N if any sessions of interest, 0 otherwise}.)
