    # Given a (probably random) starting state, returns a state that approximately minimizes an arbitrary "energy" metric.
    #
    # The given start_state must respond to:
    #  - *energy*: Returns the metric you want to optimize.
    #  - *random_neighbor*:
    #      Returns a randomly selected new state which differs slightly from this one.
    #      This method _must not modify_ the original state, but instead return a clean copy.
    #      You must ensure that the entire state space you want to search is reachable by hopping from neighbor to
    #      neighbor. Ideally, the new state should be likely to have similar energy (i.e. "neighbors" should be small changes);
    #      at the same time, you don't want it to require too many hops between any two states.
