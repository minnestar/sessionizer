module Scheduling
  # ActiveModel access is slow enough that we create a stripped-down, in-memory version of the various
  # models we need to create a schedule, then run the annealer against this in-memory model.
  # This class sucks all the sessions and timeslots from the DB, and provides them during annealing.
  #
  # A Context, its Person objects, and their SessionSets do _not_ change during annealing.
  # The Schedule class contains all the state we're trying to optimize.

      # manually_scheduled and assigning either no timeslot (like Indie Arcade) or an unschedulable
      # timeslot (like Session 0). The scoring system would count that as an unresolvable problem
      # for the presenter, since it wants every one of their sessions to be in a schedulable timeslot.
      # We therefore ignore those sessions altogether for scheduling purposes.
