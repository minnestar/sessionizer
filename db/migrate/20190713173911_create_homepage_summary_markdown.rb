        ### How long are sessions?

        Sessions can be at most **50 minutes** long. If you need extra time, there will be empty small breakout rooms available.

        ### What kind of sessions are OK?

        If you're interested in a topic, chances are others are too. Types of sessions could include **presentations** (on a programming language, cool project, marketing, music, or anything else), **panel discussions**, **hackfests**, or **meetups**.

        **What's not OK?** Minnebar is not a forum for advertisements or snake oil sales.

        If you've got an idea for a session and you want to run it by us, email casey@minnestar.org or support@minnestar.org.

        ### No Spectators, Only Participants

        The first rule of Minnebar is **No Spectators, Only Participants**. We encourage everyone to participate in the event by presenting, hosting a discussion, or even just participating in discussions and Q&A. Come ready to engage with your peers, share something you know, and learn something new!

        ### Sessions from Past Events

        All demos and sessions from past minneâœ± events have been imported into our [wiki](http://wiki.minnestar.org/). Take a stroll down memory lane with [Minnebar 1](http://wiki.minnestar.org/wiki/MinneBar_1)... and everything in between.
